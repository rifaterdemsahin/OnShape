Creating a cube in Onshape is quite straightforward. Here are the steps you can follow:

1. **Create a New Document**:
   - Open Onshape and create a new document.

2. **Start a Sketch**:
   - Select a plane (e.g., the top plane) and start a new sketch on it.

3. **Draw a Square**:
   - Use the rectangle tool to draw a square. You can use the center point rectangle tool to make it easier to center your square.
   - Apply equal constraints to the sides to ensure it's a square.
   - Dimension the sides to your desired length (e.g., 2 inches).

4. **Extrude the Sketch**:
   - Finish the sketch and use the extrude tool to give it depth.
   - Set the depth equal to the side length of the square to create a cube (e.g., 2 inches).

5. **Finalize the Cube**:
   - Confirm the extrusion, and you should have a cube.
